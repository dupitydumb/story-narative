These terrifying alien predators have evolved—or been designed—to strike fear into the hearts of any who dare set foot on Eden-9. Their singular purpose seems to be hunting and eliminating intruders, making them the ultimate nightmare for any player
## Backstory
the Harbingers were engineered in the dark laboratories of a forgotten alien regime. Originally created as soldiers in a brutal cosmic conflict, they were designed to be ruthless and efficient killers. When the war ended, their creators vanished into oblivion, leaving the Harbingers to roam the abandoned battlefields and hidden corners of Eden-9. Over countless millennia, these bio-engineered warriors adapted to the harsh, post-apocalyptic environment of their new home.

the Dread Harbingers are more than just mindless killers—they are the living embodiment of Eden-9’s hostility. Their sudden appearances in dark corridors, eerie forests, or derelict structures create high-tension moments. Players must learn to interpret subtle environmental clues—a fleeting glow, an unnatural silence, or disturbing sounds—to avoid or confront these lethal hunters.
