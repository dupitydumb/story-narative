**Origin & Backstory:** The Skitterkin evolved deep within the planetâ€™s labyrinthine underbelly. Once part of a sophisticated, hive-minded species that ruled the subterranean corridors of a dying star system, they fractured into smaller, independent packs after a catastrophic internal collapse. Now, they crawl through narrow, winding tunnels and emerge unexpectedly on the surface to ambush unsuspecting intruders. Their existence is fueled by a primal instinct to hunt and eliminate any life that dares disturb their dark domain.
