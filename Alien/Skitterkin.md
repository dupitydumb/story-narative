**Origin & Backstory:** The Skitterkin evolved deep within the planetâ€™s labyrinthine underbelly. Once part of a sophisticated, hive-minded species that ruled the subterranean corridors of a dying star system, they fractured into smaller, independent packs after a catastrophic internal collapse. Now, they crawl through narrow, winding tunnels and emerge unexpectedly on the surface to ambush unsuspecting intruders. Their existence is fueled by a primal instinct to hunt and eliminate any life that dares disturb their dark domain.

**Appearance:** The Skitterkin resembles a twisted fusion of insect and arachnid parts. Its elongated, armored body is a deep, dark blue, with iridescent highlights that shimmer in the dim light of their subterranean lairs. Eight spindly legs propel it forward with unnatural speed, their tips tipped with razor-sharp claws. Two glowing red orbs serve as eyes, fixed on the horizon as if constantly searching for prey. A series of jagged, armored plates protect its back, while a pair of serrated mandibles snap open and shut with a deadly deliberation. The Skitterkin emits a constant, maddening hissing sound as it moves, a sound that can drive even the bravest of explorers to the brink of madness.
