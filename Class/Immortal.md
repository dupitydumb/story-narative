**Story:**  
The Immortals have ruled over humanity for centuries, building empires and shaping the course of history. They have transcended mortality, their bodies infused with the Eterna Serum, granting them eternal youth and vitality. But with this gift comes a curse - the insatiable hunger for power.

As the years went by, the Immortals began to crave more and more power, using their wealth and influence to manipulate and control the masses. They built sprawling cities, towering skyscrapers, and opulent palaces, all designed to showcase their dominance. But beneath the surface, cracks began to form.

The Immortals, once united in their pursuit of power, began to turn against each other. Petty squabbles over territory and resources escalated into full-blown wars, as each Immortal sought to assert their dominance over the others. The once-mighty empires began to crumble, as the Immortals' internal struggles weakened their grip on power.

And yet, despite their own weakness, the Immortals continued to rule over humanity, using their power and influence to keep the masses in line. But as the years went by, the people began to grow restless, sensing the fragility of their rulers. The Immortals, once invincible, were now vulnerable, their grip on power tenuous at best.
