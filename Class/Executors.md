**Story:**  
The Executors are the powerful, influential, and ruthless leaders of the remaining corporate empires. They command private armies, control AI networks, and reside in fortified orbital citadels. Few genuine role models exist among them, but those who do are determined to change the course of human history for the better. They are the guardians of the law, the enforcers of the status quo, and the puppeteers of the masses. But as the Exodus Fleet departs, leaving Earth to its fate, the Executors are faced with a daunting reality: their power is built upon the ruins of civilization. They must confront the consequences of their actions and decide whether to continue down the path of destruction or forge a new path towards redemption.
