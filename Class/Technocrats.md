**Story:**  
The Technocrats are masters of technology, having spent years honing their skills in the corporate academies. They are the ones who keep the machines running, the AI systems online, and the terraforming equipment operational. In return for their loyalty, they receive modest access to the serum, ensuring their continued survival.

As the years went by, the Technocrats began to realize that their skills were not limited to mere maintenance. They could use their knowledge to create, to improve, and to innovate. They built their own drones, programmed to serve as their eyes and ears in the vast expanse of space. They upgraded their ships, making them faster, stronger, and more maneuverable. They even created their own AI systems, capable of making decisions without human oversight.

The Technocrats soon discovered that their abilities went far beyond mere technical expertise. They could control the very fabric of technology itself, using their knowledge to bend the machines to their will. They could summon swarms of drones to do their bidding, or command a ship to jump into hyperspace. They could even control the AI systems that governed the terraforming process, shaping the very planet itself to their whims.

And yet, with great power comes great responsibility. The Technocrats soon realized that their abilities were not limited to themselves. They could also be used against them. The corporations, who had once been their patrons, now saw the Technocrats as a threat. They began to hunt them down, using their own technology against them.

The Technocrats were forced to go into hiding, using their skills to stay one step ahead of their pursuers. They formed their own secret society, a group of like-minded individuals who shared their vision of a technological utopia. And they waited, patiently, for the day when they could strike back against their oppressors, and reclaim their rightful place as the masters of technology.
