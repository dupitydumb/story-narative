**Story:**  
The Drillworkers are the lowest of the low. They are the disposable, the ones who are nothing more than tools to be used and discarded. They are forced to live in squalid conditions, with barely enough food to survive. They are given minimal equipment, and are expected to work until they drop. And when they do, they are simply replaced. The Drillworkers are nothing more than slaves, forced to toil in the depths of mines and on the surfaces of hostile planets. They have no rights, no privileges, and no hope. They are the fuel that powers the Exodus Fleet, and they are nothing more.

The Drillworkers, despite their enslavement, have a sense of unity and togetherness. They are divided by the house/location they are assigned to, but they all share the same struggle. They are the ones who work tirelessly to power the Exodus Fleet, and they are the ones who are the most powerless. But in the depths of their mines and on the surfaces of hostile planets, they have found a sense of community and solidarity. They know that they are not alone, and that they are all in this together. And it is this sense of unity that gives them the strength to keep going, to keep fighting, and to keep hoping for a better future.

As the Drillworkers discovered the truth behind their enslavement, they were filled with a desire for revenge. They wanted to fight back against their oppressors, to take back control of their own lives and to bring an end to the suffering. But they were powerless. The corporations had the guns, the money, and the power. The Drillworkers had nothing but their own determination.

A few important figures among the Drillworkers were rounded up and jailed, their voices silenced before they could spread dissent. Others were executed, their bodies left as a warning to those who would dare to question the corporations. But the Drillworkers did not give up. They continued to whisper among themselves, to share their stories and to plan their rebellion. They knew that one day, they would rise up and take back what was rightfully theirs. And they would bring an end to the suffering of the Drillworkers.

The Drillworkers, in their darkest moments, created a song. A song that captured their struggle, their pain, and their willingness to fight. The song was a lament, a cry for help, and a call to arms. It was a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. The corporations, fearing the power of the song, banned it. They arrested anyone who dared to sing it, and they destroyed any evidence of its existence. But the Drillworkers would not forget. They would continue to sing the song, in secret, in hushed tones, and in the depths of their mines. And they would keep fighting, until they were free.
