**Connection to Timeline:**

- Formed in the aftermath of the [[2067 – Earth’s Destruction]], these individuals were left without a home as the world they knew was obliterated. Scattered among the stars, they became a subclass known as the Roamers.

- With no fixed abode, the Roamers drift from system to system, trading goods and information, often acting as intermediaries between warring factions. Their nomadic lifestyle is both a curse and a blessing, as they are free from the constraints of planetary governments but constantly face the perils of deep space.

- Many Roamers have taken up bounty hunting to make ends meet, leveraging their extensive networks and intimate knowledge of the galaxy's dark corners. They are known for their resourcefulness and tenacity, traits honed from years of surviving on the fringes of society.

- Despite their reputation as outcasts, the Roamers have a code of honor, fiercely protecting their own and offering sanctuary to those in need. They are a testament to humanity's resilience, adapting and thriving in the harshest of environments while carving out a unique existence among the stars.
