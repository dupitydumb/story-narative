**Role:** Corporate soldiers and police tasked with maintaining order.  
**Privileges:** Access to basic serum doses, advanced weapons, and authority over lower castes.

**Story:**  
The Enforcers are the blunt instruments of the corporate elite. They are the ones who keep the peace, who maintain order, and who punish those who dare to question the status quo. They are the lowest rung on the ladder of power, but they are the ones who hold the guns.

The Enforcers are the descendants of the mercenaries who fought in the Resource Wars. They were the ones who were hired to protect the corporate interests, to secure the supply lines, and to quell the rebellions. They were the ones who were paid to fight, to kill, and to die.

Over time, the Enforcers became the de facto police force of the corporations. They were the ones who patrolled the streets, who kept the peace, and who enforced the will of the elite. They were the ones who were tasked with keeping the lower castes in line, with punishing those who dared to question the authority of the corporations.

The Enforcers are not the most powerful, nor are they the most respected. But they are the ones who hold the power, who wield the guns, and who keep the system running. They are the ones who are feared, who are reviled, and who are necessary.
