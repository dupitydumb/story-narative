**Story:**

Eden, a once-pristine planet, was discovered in the distant reaches of the galaxy. The first human settlers, escaping the dying Earth, arrived in the mid-22nd century. Initially, they were awestruck by the planet's breathtaking landscapes and teeming wildlife.

In the year 2175, the United Government (UG) launched the **Eden Revival Initiative**. The program aimed to restore the planet's ecosystem and make it habitable. The UEG invested heavily in advanced terraforming technology, importing massive machines from Earth to revitalize the environment.

As the terraforming process progressed, Eden began to transform. The skies cleared, the oceans cleansed, and new life sprouted from the barren soil. The settlers, who had grown accustomed to the harsh conditions, were initially wary of the changes. However, as the planet flourished, they began to see Eden in a new light.

Today, Eden is a beacon of hope for humanity. The planet is home to a thriving colony, where humans live in harmony with the restored environment. The settlers have learned from their past mistakes and now work to maintain the balance of nature. Eden has become a symbol of redemption, a testament to humanity's capacity to adapt and evolve.

**Environment:**

- **Terraformed Landscape:** Eden's landscape is a mix of restored natural wonders and artificial structures. Towering forests, teeming with life, stretch towards the sky. Rivers flow with crystal-clear water, and the oceans are home to a diverse array of marine life.
- **Colonial Architecture:** The settlers have built sprawling cities, blending seamlessly into the natural environment. The architecture is a mix of sustainable, eco-friendly designs and retrofitted structures from the early days of colonization.

**Hazards:**

- **Terraforming Instabilities:** The planet's ecosystem is still fragile, and sudden changes in the environment can have catastrophic consequences. Players must navigate the unpredictable nature of Eden's terraforming process.
- **Remnants of the Past:** Abandoned machinery, toxic waste, and other remnants of the pre-terraforming era still pose a threat to the settlers. Players must be cautious when exploring the planet's surface, as these hazards can be deadly.
