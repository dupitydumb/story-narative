**Hazards:**

- **Magma Surges:** Sudden eruptions that incinerate unprepared players.
- **Crawlers:** Insectoid creatures with razor-sharp exoskeletons that ambush from crevices.

**Environment:**

- **Barren Landscapes:** A planet with similarities to Earth, but with a surface more akin to the Moon's. Volcanic regions cover a third of the surface, with towering volcanic mountains spewing lava and ash into the atmosphere. Valleys are formed by lava flows, and the ground is cracked and broken. The atmosphere is thin, and the sky is a sickly yellow due to the volcanic gases. The temperature is scorching hot during the day and freezing cold at night.
