**Environment:**

- **Frozen Wasteland:** A planet encased in ice, with hurricane-force blizzards and mile-deep crevasses. The surface is dotted with **bioluminescent algae** that glow underfoot.
- **Key Feature:** The **Frostspire Citadel**—a massive alien structure buried in the ice, emitting a low-frequency pulse.

**Hazards:**

- **Hypothermia:** Players must scavenge thermal batteries or freeze to death.

**Story:**

- **The Last Hope Colony:** In the early days of space exploration, humanity sent a colonization ship to Nox, hoping to find a new home. The ship, named **Hope's Endeavor**, vanished into the unknown. Decades later, a weak distress signal was detected, and the ship was found crashed on Nox's surface. The colony was never heard from again.
