**Environment:**

- **Frozen Wasteland:** A planet encased in ice, with hurricane-force blizzards and mile-deep crevasses.
  **Hazards:**

- **Hypothermia:** Players must scavenge thermal batteries or freeze to death.

**Story:**

- **The Last Hope Colony:** In the early days of space exploration, humanity sent a colonization ship to Nox, hoping to find a new home. The ship, named **Hope's Endeavor**, vanished into the unknown. Decades later, a weak distress signal was detected, and the ship was found crashed on Nox's surface. The colony was never heard from again.

- **Planet Condition:** Nox is a desolate, frozen world, perpetually locked in a cycle of extreme cold. The atmosphere is thin and composed mainly of nitrogen, with trace amounts of oxygen, making it inhospitable for unaided human life. The surface is covered in layers of ice and snow, with treacherous crevasses that can stretch for miles. The relentless blizzards reduce visibility and can disorient even the most experienced explorers.

- **Abandoned Structures:** Scattered across the icy plains are remnants of the **Last Hope Colony**. These structures, now buried under snowdrifts, once housed the hopeful settlers of **Hope's Endeavor**. The buildings are constructed from reinforced materials, designed to withstand the harsh climate but have succumbed to the relentless passage of time. Inside, remnants of the colony's life can still be found—frozen meals, personal belongings, and equipment left untouched since the colonists' mysterious disappearance.

- **Atmospheric Details:** The air on Nox carries an eerie stillness, punctuated only by the howling winds of the blizzards. Occasionally, the sky is lit by the ethereal glow of auroras, a rare spectacle caused by solar winds interacting with the planet's magnetic field. The bioluminescent algae, scattered across the surface, emit a faint green glow that provides the only source of light during the long, dark nights.

- **Small Details:** Explorers may come across peculiar ice formations, shaped by the planet's unique weather patterns. The ice itself is a deep blue, with veins of minerals giving it an otherworldly appearance. Occasionally, the low-frequency pulse of the **Frostspire Citadel** can be felt resonating through the ice, a constant reminder of the planet's enigmatic past.
